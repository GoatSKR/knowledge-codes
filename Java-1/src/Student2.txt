Design and develop a menu-driven Student Management System for HitachiAcademy  . The Student Management System maintains student details such as name, age and scores of students in 5 subjects. Perform the below tasks.
1)	Create a parameterized constructor in the Student class to initialize the name, age, and scores attributes.
2)	In the main method of the same class, create an ArrayList of Student objects to represent three students.
3)	Implement a menu-driven system that allows the user to:
a)	Input details for each student (name, age, and scores).
b)	Calculate and display the average score for each student.
c)	Print the details of each student along with average score in the format given below. Example : Name : Nitin, Age : 25, Average Score : 89
d)	Sorting: After collecting student details,
sort the ArrayList of students based on their average
scores in ascending or descending order.
e)	Search: Implement a search functionality where the
user can input a student's name, and the program should
display the details of that student if found.
f)	Updating Scores: Allow the user to update the scores
of a specific student. After updating the scores, recalculate
the average score and display it.
g)	Remove Students: Implement the ability to remove a student
from the ArrayList based on their name or other criteria.
Name to be removed should be taken as input from user.
h)	Exit the program.
