Design and develop a menu-driven Student Management System for
HitachiAcademy. The Student Management System maintains student
details such as name, age, and scores of students in 5 subjects.

Perform the following tasks:
1.	Create a parameterized constructor in the Student class to
initialize the name, age, and scores attributes.
2.	In the main method of the same class, create an array of
Student objects to represent three students.
3.	Implement a menu-driven system that allows the user to:
a.	Input details for each student (name, age, and scores).
b.	Calculate and display the average score for each student.
c.	Print the details of each student along with the average
score in the format: "Name: [Name], Age: [Age], Average Score: [Average Score]"
d.	Exit the Program.
