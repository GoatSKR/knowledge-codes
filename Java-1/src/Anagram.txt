Concepts : Strings, Arrays.

Write a Java program that checks if two input sentences are anagrams of
each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the
letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters
exactly once. For this problem, consider spaces and punctuation marks.
●	Prompt the user to enter two sentences (strings).
●	Check if the two input sentences are anagrams of each other.
●	Display the result, indicating whether the sentences are anagrams
or not.

The program should perform the following checks:
●	Ignore spaces and punctuation marks (e.g., consider "Hello, world!" and "world, Hello!" as anagrams).
●	Be case-insensitive (e.g., consider "Hello" and "hello" as anagrams).
●	Consider sentences with the same words but in different orders as anagrams (e.g., "I am Sam" and "Sam I am" are anagrams).

Sample Input and Output :
Enter the first sentence: Listen, silent.
Enter the second sentence: Listen Silent
Result: The sentences are anagrams.
